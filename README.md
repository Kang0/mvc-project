Welcome to Record Your Records!

This application uses a database of user created vinyl's that any user can add to their collection. Once a user has signed up, they can add any vinyls they can not find in the database into the database. The application gives the option to edit or delete the created database vinyl. Furthermore, the user can add the database vinyl to their own collection. Once added, the user can edit the vinyl in their own collection as well as delete the vinyl from their collection. The user also has the ability to search their own collection to find a specific vinyl.

Enjoy!
